# Memory-Game
PMF Memory - simple web game made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The game was made as a project for a Web programming course, and that's why it's very simple. In this project, we were supposed to use HTML, CSS and Javascript and show the knowledge we acquired during the semester.
The game is popular and I believe that everyone knows the rules, but I will write the instructions.

The goal of the PMF Memory game is to match all the cards.
There are 2n cards on the board, where n is the number of different cards. Each of the n cards contains one of the motifs of the Faculty of Science. The cards are arranged in random order.

The images can include professors, assistants, classrooms, faculty images and other motifs. Each of the cards is on the board exactly twice.
All cards are face up (face down) on the board. In each move, the player chooses two cards and turns them over. If the chosen cards are the same, the cards remain open.
If the motifs are different, after a short time, the cards are turned face down again and the player plays a new move. The game ends when the player correctly matches (opens) all the cards.
